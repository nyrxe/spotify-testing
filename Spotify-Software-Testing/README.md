# Spotify-Software-Testing
This is a QA project for Spotify web page

So what this scripts does basicly they test soem predetermented functinalities. they all work as one script and referance each other quite often so you need to execute `main.py` to get results. This was done to have a easier time with performance testing. which there is still some works to be done in that area. You can follow my progress from Projects section if you are interested.

Mainly what i think about this projects feature comes to three things
- Finish performance testing
- re-examine the program
- write documantation
  - Anallysis doc
  - Functinality doc
  - Performance testing doc
  - README
